            <p>Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Doc, she didn't even look at him. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.
                Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Never? Marty, you made it. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc How's your head?
                Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Uh, look me up when you get there. What a nightmare.
